# What is Programming
Programming means telling a computer step-by-step what to do using a programming language like Python, Java, or C++.

Low-Level Programming = Talking directly to the computer’s brain (CPU) in its own language (numbers/binary/assembly).

High-Level Programming = Talking to the computer in a human-like language (English-like words), and then a translator converts it into machine language.

In programming, portable means that the same code can run on different computers or operating systems without major changes.

Dynamically typed → You don’t declare variable types; Python decides at runtime.

Interpreted → Python code runs line by line, no need for a separate compile step.

What happens when you install Python?

The Python installer (from python.org or Anaconda, etc.) includes:

Python Interpreter → The program that reads and executes your .py files.

Standard Library → A collection of built-in modules and tools.

PIP (Package Installer for Python) → To install extra libraries.


## Module
A module in Python is a file that contains Python code — typically functions, classes, and variables — organized together to reuse and structure your code.

\ escape char
\n excape sequence

Floor Division (//)

// means floor division → divide two numbers and round the result down to the nearest integer.

"Down" means toward negative infinity (not just "cutting the decimal").
ceil(x) = smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

Positive step → Think: "Walk right until just before stop."

Negative step → Think: "Walk left until just before stop."
