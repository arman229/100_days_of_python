    "# Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?\n",
    "## What is Programming\n",
    "Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. \n",
    "If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. \n",
    "How about 23453453 X 56456?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. \n",
    "This 100 days of code series will help you learn python from starting to the end. We will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a Job ready Python developer!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.\n",
    "-   Python is a high-level programming language that is:\n",
    "-   Easy to read and write (uses simple English-like syntax).\n",
    "-   Portable (the same code can run on Windows, Mac, Linux without changes).\n",
    "-   Interpreted (runs line by line, no need to compile before running).\n",
    "-   It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What happens when you install Python?\n",
    "- The Python installer (from python.org or Anaconda, etc.) includes:\n",
    "    - Python Interpreter → The program that reads and executes your .py files.\n",
    "    - Standard Library → A collection of built-in modules and tools.\n",
    "    - PIP (Package Installer for Python) → To install extra libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python is **Dynamically Typed**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Typing** means how the language handles **data types** (integer, string, float, etc.).\n",
    "* In **statically typed languages** (like C, Java):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You must **declare the type** of a variable before using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "  int x = 10;  // x is an integer\n",
    "  x = \"hello\"; // ❌ Error\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* In **dynamically typed languages** (like Python):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You **don’t need to declare the type**. Python figures it out automatically at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  x = 10        # x is now an integer\n",
    "  x = \"hello\"   # now x is a string (allowed in Python)\n",
    "  ``` \n",
    "✅ This makes Python flexible and easy for beginners, but can cause runtime errors if types are mixed incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "General-purpose (you can use it for many things: web apps, AI, data science, automation, games, etc.).\n",
    "## Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Python is simple and easy to understand.\n",
    "-   It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.\n",
    "-   Python is an open-source programming language.\n",
    "-   Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.\n",
    "-   It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python used for\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.\n",
    "-   Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.\n",
    "-   It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.\n",
    "-   It is used to create web applications.\n",
    "-   It can be used to handle databases.\n",
    "-   It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    "## What is mypy?\n",
    "- mypy is a static type checker for Python.\n",
    "- Python itself is dynamically typed, but with mypy (and type hints) you can add optional type checking.\n",
    "- It doesn’t change how Python runs — it just checks your code before execution for potential type errors. "
